:Release: 1.2.2
:Date: 2017/03/30

Purpose
-------

A python script to generate a cscope index from a Python source
tree.  `pycscope` uses Python's own parser and (C)oncrete (S)yntax
(T)ree to generate the index, so it is a bit more accurate than
plain cscope.


Usage
-----

::

    pycscope.py [-D] [-R] [-S] [-V] [-f reffile] [-i srclistfile] [files ...]
    -D              Dump the (C)oncrete (S)yntax (T)ree generated by the parser for each file
    -R              Recurse directories for files
    -S              Interpret simple strings as symbols
    -V              Print version and exit
    -f reffile      Use 'reffile' as cross-ref file name instead of 'cscope.out'
    -i srclistfile  Use the contents of 'srclistfile' as the list of source files to scan

Install
-------

PyCscope uses Python's distutils package for installation.
Use the following command to install this package::

    % python setup.py install


Features
--------

PyCscope has the following features:

    - Supports both Python 2.7 and Python 3
    - Command line interface
    - Output can be used by the `CscopeFinder` plugin for jEdit
    - Marks for all files ending in `.py`
    - Marks for all `class` definitions
    - Marks for all defined functions
    - Marks for function calls (algorithm is not perfect)
    - Marks for end-of-function (no search uses this mark yet)
    - Marks for imported modules (use the search for #include)
    - Marks for symbol assignment

A *mark* is an indicator to the cscope utility that something
of interest follows.


History
-------

pycscope 0.3a and later are written and copyright Peter Portante.
pycscope 0.1 - 0.3 were originally written and copyright Dean Hall.


Status
------

It works well enough to generate an index file that can be used
by the `CscopeFinder` plugin for jEdit.  Other editors are not tested.

                              nose, generating coverage by default; fix broken
                              unit tests that were not properly run before the

                              pyxcscope integration for (X)Emacs.

----------  --------- ------  ----------------------------------------------------
2012/09/19  0.3e-pajp N/A     Fix issues #7 and #8: we now properly handle symbols
                              closest to the assignment itself (rather than the
                              first one), and replace the crazy comma counting
                              method with a more stable pattern recognition method
                              that explicitly records which tuples should receive
                              the assignment mark; fixed handling of import state-
                              ments of the form, "from . import moda"

                              thus allowing symbol assignment marking to work as
                              coded (if not correctly, see Issue #7).
----------  --------- ------  ----------------------------------------------------
2012/09/11  0.3b-pajp N/A     Include changes from fspeech to get it working for
                              Python 3; add proper support for yield expression
                              following an augmented assignment; added support
                              for filename and line numbers when assertions fire;
                              fixed handling of commas on the left hand side of
                              assignment statements; gracefully handle errors
